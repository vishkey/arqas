Description: Provides functions to compute the main characteristics of the
    following queueing models: M/M/1, M/M/s, M/M/1/k, M/M/s/k, M/M/1/Inf/H, M/
    M/s/Inf/H, M/M/s/Inf/H with Y replacements, M/M/Inf, Open Jackson Networks
    and Closed Jackson Networks. Moreover, it is also possible to simulate
    similar queueing models with any type of arrival or service distribution: G/
    G/1, G/G/s, G/G/1/k, G/G/s/k, G/G/1/Inf/H, G/G/s/Inf/H, G/G/s/Inf/H with Y
    replacements, Open Networks and Closed Networks. Finally, contains functions
    for fit data to a statistic distribution.
