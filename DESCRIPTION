Description: This package implements the main characteristics of the following
    queueing models: M/M/1, M/M/s, M/M/1/k, M/M/s/k, M/M/1/Inf/H, M/M/s/Inf/H,
    M/M/s/Inf/H with Y replacements, M/M/Inf, Open Jackson Networks and Closed
    Jackson Networks. Moreover, it is also possible to simulate similar
    queueing models with any type of arrival or service distribution: G/G/1,
    G/G/s, G/G/1/k, G/G/s/k, G/G/1/Inf/H, G/G/s/Inf/H, G/G/s/Inf/H with Y
    replacements, Open Networks and Closed Networks.
